# PocketStock
### A simple app I made to learn the MVP Architecture
The app lets you store items with their quantity and price. Also, notifies the user whenever an item is low on stock.

This app implemented:
- CRUD operations using Room Database
- RecyclerView
- Login/Register features with simple session management
